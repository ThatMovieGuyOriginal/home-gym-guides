### Strength Training Basics: What You Need to Know

#### What is Strength Training?
At its core, strength training involves using resistance to build muscle and increase strength. This can be accomplished with several types of equipment:

- **Free Weights:** Think dumbbells and barbells.
- **Machines:** Equipment designed to target specific muscle groups.
- **Bodyweight Exercises:** Movements such as push-ups, squats, and planks.
- **Resistance Bands:** Highly portable and perfect for beginners.

#### Why Strength Training Matters
- **Boosts Metabolism:** Increased lean muscle mass means your body burns more calories even at rest.
- **Improves Bone Health:** Resistance training strengthens bones and reduces the risk of osteoporosis.
- **Enhances Functional Fitness:** Everyday tasks like carrying groceries or climbing stairs become easier.
- **Builds Confidence:** Every improvement in strength fuels your motivation to keep progressing.

#### Busting Common Myths
**Myth:** Lifting weights will make you bulky.  
**Fact:** With the right approach, you'll build a lean, toned physique while increasing your strength and endurance.

- **Overtraining:** Your muscles need time to recover. Schedule rest days to allow for proper recovery.
- **Skipping Nutrition:** Fuel your body with a balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats.
- **Comparing Yourself:** Focus on your own progress rather than comparing to others.
- **Neglecting Progress Tracking:** Keep a workout journal or use fitness apps like MyFitnessPal or Strong to track your improvements.

### Nutrition for Strength Training Beginners

Building muscle requires more than just workouts—nutrition is key:
- **Protein:** Aim for 0.7–1 gram per pound of body weight daily. Lean proteins such as chicken, tofu, and eggs are excellent choices.
- **Carbohydrates:** Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables provide the necessary energy to power your workouts.
- **Supplements:** If needed, a quality whey protein supplement can help you meet your protein goals.
